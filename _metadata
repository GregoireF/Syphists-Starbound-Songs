  "description" : "Adds some extra songs to starbound.\n\nThis pack includes song(s) from the artists and/or games (including but not limited to):\nWaterflame\nTzar Burden of the Crown\nTouhou\nHalo\nCave Story\nMetroid\nSuper Metroid\nPokemon\nDOOM\nRunescape\nSonic\nSuper Mario 64\nHomestuck\nxi\nMinecraft\nYoshi's Island\nMegaman\nFinal Fantasy (Japanese Numbers used)\nLoZ Breath of the Wild\nMario Kart Super Circuit\nOverwatch\nTeam Fortress 2\nStar Wars\nA Hat in Time\n\nView the full file list here:\nhttps://pastebin.com/JcEExR7H\n\nDRM Free version can be downloaded here:\nhttp://u.syphist.com/syph_song_pack.pak\n\nMost drumkit parts should be optional and are there to give your friend something to do and to not make the instrument useless. All parts marked as \"Solo\" are played with the part labeled \"Piano\", to play both parts at once select the one labeled \"Both\". (I don't wanna penalize people who like to play single player) This pack is also designed to resonate more or less with CrazyFreak's Musical Collection (found here: http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=729773633 ). If you have any questions or suggestions feel free to comment.\n\nI am pushing updates out in multiple releases and you will see the songbook expand. I hope you enjoy these songs.\n\nDisclaimer:\nI own none of the works published in this mod, it is just a compilation to make your lives easier.\nThe thumbnail was created by EnderKafai, and the gif was taken straight from the Starbound gamepedia wiki.\nAll other songs are attributed to their original creators and those who originally arranged the midis. (A majority of which I pulled from khinsider.com, musescore.com or vgmusic.com)\nThe only work I have contributed to these abc files are in the Megaman 2 Theme arrangement (I transcribed sheet music to abc for that one) and any slight changes like removing rests and changing pitch bending. Everything else was created by another party, and I do not take responsibility for their work.\n\nSpecial Thanks:\nI would like to give a special thanks to BusiedGem on YouTube to providing many high quality MIDIs I converted. If you like a lot of the work with A Hat in Time, Breath of Wild, and Terraria tracks you should definitely check them out at https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCMLqR6uhl_uANtw-aMO77Mw/videos",
