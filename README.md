Most drumkit parts should be optional and are there to give your friend something to do and to not make the instrument useless. All parts marked as "Solo" are played with the part labeled "Piano", to play both parts at once select the one labeled "Both". (I don't wanna penalize people who like to play single player) This pack is also designed to resonate more or less with CrazyFreak's Musical Collection (found here: http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=729773633 ). If you have any questions or suggestions feel free to comment.

I am pushing updates out in multiple releases and you will see the songbook expand. I hope you enjoy these songs.

Disclaimer:
I own none of the works published in this mod, it is just a compilation to make your lives easier.
The thumbnail was created by EnderKafai, and the gif was taken straight from the Starbound gamepedia wiki.
All other songs are attributed to their original creators and those who originally arranged the midis. (A majority of which I pulled from khinsider.com, musescore.com or vgmusic.com)
The only work I have contributed to these abc files are in the Megaman 2 Theme arrangement (I transcribed sheet music to abc for that one) and any slight changes like removing rests and changing pitch bending. Everything else was created by another party, and I do not take responsibility for their work.

Special Thanks:
I would like to give a special thanks to BusiedGem on YouTube to providing many high quality MIDIs I converted. If you like a lot of the work with A Hat in Time, Breath of Wild, and Terraria tracks you should definitely check them out at https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCMLqR6uhl_uANtw-aMO77Mw/videos
